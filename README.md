# Final-Year-Project-Intelligent-surveillance-access-control-System-
As part of my final year project at university, I developed a face recognition and credit card verification system using Azure Cognitive Services. The system is designed to grant access to a secure location or service by recognizing a person's face and verifying their credit card details. The system captures an image of the user's face using a camera, then uses Azure Cognitive Services to detect and verify the face. The user is then prompted to enter their credit card details, which are extracted using OCR and verified using object detection. If the credit card details match, the system uses a Raspberry Pi speaker and text-to-speech to announce the user's name and grant them access
