# Final-Year-Project-Intelligent-surveillance-access-control-System-
For my final year project at university, I created a face recognition and student card verification system using Azure Cognitive Services. The aim of the project was to develop a system that could grant access to a secure location or service by verifying a person's identity using their face and student card. The system captures an image of the user's face using a camera, then uses Azure Cognitive Services to detect and verify the face. The user is then prompted to swipe their student card, which is verified using object detection. If the student card matches the user's face, the system uses a Raspberry Pi speaker and text-to-speech to announce the user's name and grant them access. If the person tries to use an ID card instead of a student card, they will be denied access. This project showcases my skills in Azure Cognitive Services, object detection, and Raspberry Pi programming.
